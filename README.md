# üöÄ Advanced AI Projects: Knowledge Graphs, Multimodal RAG, and Multi-Agent Systems

Welcome to my AI Projects repository! This repository showcases a series of advanced AI solutions I‚Äôve developed, building on foundational concepts like LLM fine-tuning, LoRA, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Here, you‚Äôll find detailed implementations of Knowledge Graphs, Multimodal Systems, and Multi-Agent Frameworks designed to tackle complex, real-world problems.

# üåê Project 1: Knowledge Graphs with Neo4j
Tech Stack:
Neo4j: Graph database for storing and querying complex data relationships.
LangChain: Framework for integrating LLMs with graph-based data.
Cypher: Query language for interacting with the Neo4j database.
Pipeline:
Setup Neo4j Database: Configure the graph database with disaster-related data.
Cypher Query Execution: Use Cypher queries to retrieve and analyze relationships.
Graph-based QA: Implement a question-answering system leveraging LangChain and the knowledge graph.
Why This is Powerful:
Knowledge Graphs provide a structured way to explore relationships, offering deeper insights from interconnected data.

# üìä Project 2: Multimodal RAG for Stock Charts
Tech Stack:
ChromaDB: Persistent database for embedding and querying multimodal data.
OpenCLIP: Embedding function to process both text and image data.
LangChain: Facilitates RAG processes by combining language models with retrieved data.
Pipeline:
Data Preparation: Embed stock chart images and corresponding textual data.
Query System: Use ChromaDB to retrieve relevant multimodal data.
RAG Integration: Combine retrieved images and text for coherent, context-rich responses.
Why This is Powerful:
Integrating text and image data provides a comprehensive view of stock performance, improving decision-making in financial analysis.

# ü§ñ Project 3: Multi-Agent Investment Analysis
Tech Stack:
CrewAI: For building and managing multi-agent systems.
LangChain: Powers the language-based processing tasks.
Gradio: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
Pipeline:
Agent Creation: Develop specialized agents for tasks like data retrieval, analysis, and strategy formulation.
Task Coordination: Agents collaborate to process data and provide investment insights.
User Interaction: Use Gradio to enable real-time interaction with the multi-agent system.
Why This is Powerful:
Multi-Agent Systems offer scalability and modularity, allowing complex tasks to be efficiently managed through specialized agents.
